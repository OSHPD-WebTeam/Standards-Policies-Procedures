# Naming Conventions

Directories and files are named with strict, yet flexible conventions.

- All files and directories must be named with full words or acronyms, no abbreviations allowed (except months)
- All files and directories must use a hyphen to separate words
- Spaces, underscores, and camelCase are not allowed in file names
- Names of directories are based on the structure of content and services
- If you include a document date, add it at the end of the file name and do not include the day
