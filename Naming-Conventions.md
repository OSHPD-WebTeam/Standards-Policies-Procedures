# Naming Conventions

Directories and files are named with strict, yet flexible conventions.

- All files and directories shall be named with full words or acronyms, no abbreviations allowed (except months)
- All file and directory names shall use a hyphen to separate words
- Spaces, underscores, and camelCase are not allowed
- Names of directories are based on the structure of content and services
- If you include a document date, add it at the end of the file name and do not include the day
