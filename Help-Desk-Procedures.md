* Use the “Email Requestor” option for all requestor communication
* Change status to “Waiting for Response” when action is required by requestor
* Change status to “Pending” when waiting on an IT technician (yourself included)
* Ticket Assignments
 * When working on a ticket, make sure to assign yourself
 * When re-assigning to another IT technician, provide a justification and mark note/comment as private
 * Speak with currently assigned technician before communicating with requestors on tickets that are not assigned to you.
 
## Web Request Forms 

Web Request Forms are required for new web liasons. Once a web liason has become familiar with the information required, they may choose whether to use the form or not. If a piece of important information is missing from a web request, send a Web Request Form for them to fill out.
